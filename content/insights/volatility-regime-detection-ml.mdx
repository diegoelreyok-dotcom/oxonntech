## The Regime Problem

Financial markets operate in distinct regimes — periods characterized by different statistical properties in returns, volatility, and correlation structures. The transition between regimes is often abrupt and economically significant.

Traditional volatility models (GARCH, EWMA) are backward-looking by construction. They detect regime changes only after realized volatility has already shifted, leaving portfolio managers reactive rather than anticipatory.

## Statistical Approaches to Regime Detection

We evaluate three complementary approaches to early regime identification:

### Hidden Markov Models

HMMs model observable market features (returns, implied volatility, credit spreads) as emissions from a latent state process. The Baum-Welch algorithm estimates transition probabilities, and the Viterbi algorithm decodes the most likely state sequence.

Our implementation uses a 3-state HMM with multivariate Gaussian emissions, calibrated on a rolling 252-day window of daily cross-asset features.

### Recurrent Neural Networks

LSTM networks can capture longer-range dependencies in sequential data. We train on the same feature set but allow the model to discover its own regime representation through the hidden state dynamics.

The trade-off: LSTMs require more data, are less interpretable, and risk overfitting — but they can capture non-linear regime boundaries that HMMs miss.

### Ensemble Methods

Our production system runs both approaches simultaneously and combines their regime probabilities through a Bayesian averaging framework. When both models agree on a regime transition, confidence is high. Disagreement triggers a more conservative allocation stance.

## Feature Engineering

The quality of regime detection depends critically on feature selection. Our feature set includes:

- Realized vs. implied volatility spread (VRP)
- Cross-asset correlation matrix eigenvalues
- Credit spread term structure slope
- Options skew dynamics (25-delta risk reversal)
- Market microstructure metrics (bid-ask spread percentiles)

Each feature is z-scored against its own rolling distribution to ensure stationarity.

## Practical Applications

Regime detection feeds directly into three downstream systems:

1. **Portfolio construction** — Allocation weights shift based on regime probabilities
2. **Risk budgeting** — VaR limits tighten automatically during transition periods
3. **Execution scheduling** — Trade urgency increases when regime transition probability exceeds a threshold

## Ongoing Research

Current work focuses on extending the framework to intraday regime detection and exploring transformer architectures for multi-timescale regime modeling.
